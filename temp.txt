Sensitivity / Recall =Recall = TP / (TP +FN)

Specificity = TN/ (TN+FP)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

=============
Why did you choose israel's data to study purpose ?
purpose of risk coeff.?
how did you get to this values of coefficents ?
As you mentioned in the Objective, that this result may help Doctors to treat the patients with high risk on a priority basis.?
Is there any threshold value of of risk.?
